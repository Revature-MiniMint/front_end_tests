## General Info
We wanted to include at least some white-box tests for our project 3, so we decided to use Selenium IDE to accomplish that. 

## Run Instructions
* If not installed already, you should go to https://www.selenium.dev/selenium-ide/ to download the latest version of Selenium IDE. It is in the form of a browser extension.
* Follow the instructions in [TODO] to have MiniMint up and running before you run these tests.
* Open the browser of your choice (whichever you chose to install Selenium onto), and then open the Selenium extension.
* Click on the "Open Project" button or press [Ctrl + O] and open the .side file in this repository.
* Click on the "Run All Tests" button, or press [Ctrl + Shift + R]
* NOTE: some tests may require empty databases to run successfully (i.e. you cannot register the same user twice).
